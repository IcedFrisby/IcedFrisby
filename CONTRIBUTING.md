Contributing guidelines
=======================

### Code Coverage

You can assess code coverage by running `npm run coverage`.

### Contributions

Contributions are awesome! If you have an idea or code that you want to
contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request and we will gladly
review it.

The library is post-1.0 now, so there is backward compatibility and future
maintainability to consider. If you are adding functionality, you can also
write a [plugin](#icedfrisby-plugins) and add a link here.

### Release process

The procedure for issuing a release is as follows:

1. Edit `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`, updating the version and release notes. Ensure no other files have changes.
1. Make a new commit `git commit -am 'RELEASE X.X.X'`
1. Tag the commit `git tag X.X.X`
1. Push commits and tags `git push && git push --tags`
1. Publish to npm `npm publish`

### Writing your own plugin

Writing a plugin for IcedFrisby is easy. For compatibility with other plugins,
use a [subclass factory][]:

```js
const factory = superclass => class MyPlugin extends superclass {
  expectValidXML () {
    this.after((err, res, body) => {
      // ... assert something here ...
    })
    return this
  }
}
module.exports = factory
```
