# IcedFrisby Changelog

## 3.0.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Joi 16.x contains major changes to the API.
  `.expectJSONTypes()` has been updated for compatibility with
  Joi 16.x, which is now required.

## 2.2.1

- Bug fix: Emit errors when multiple retries are exhausted.
- Update tests for nock API changes.

## 2.2.0

- Add `skipWhen()` method.

## 2.1.0

- Add `skip()` and `skipIf()` methods.

## 2.0.0

This release involves a substantial rewrite and several breaking changes from
2.0.0. The changes since 1.5.0 are summarized here.

### Breaking changes

- Joi is now an optional dependency. If you are using `expectJSONTypes` you
  must install Joi on your own.
- IcedFrisby has dropped support for Node 6 and now requires Node 8+.
- `globalConfig()` has been removed. Each test can be independently
  configured using `config()`, which takes the same options. `reset()` has
  also been removed.
- The plugin interface has changed. `this.current.expects` has been removed.
  Plugins should use `after()` instead.

### New features

- An `async run()` method has been added. This allows running IcedFrisby
  tests within `it()` blocks or using a test runner other than Mocha.

### Bug fixes

- Fix `timeout()` and `retry()` ([PR #71][])
  - Retry on errors, not just timeouts
  - Back off between retries
  - Global setup respects `retryBackoff` option
  - Configure Mocha’s timeout to accommodate `.timeout()` and `.retry()`
- Clean up after `useApp()` ([PR #72][])

### Other changes

- Remove `setResponseType` and other `setResponseX` functions which were
  not part of the public API and were unused internally.
- Significantly improve API documentation.
- Rewrite a bunch of internals using `async`.
- Rewrite tests using `async` and `run()`.
- Improve test coverage.
- Update dependencies.

## 2.0.0-alpha.5

### Bug fixes

- Correctly emit exceptions from `after()` and `finally()`

## 2.0.0-alpha.4

### Other changes

- Rewrite a bunch of internals using `async`.
- Rewrite tests using `async` and `run()`.
- Update `check-types` dependency.

## 2.0.0-alpha.3

### Breaking changes

- Remove support for Node 6.

### New features

- Add `async run()` method to support running IcedFrisby within `it()` blocks or
  using a test runner other than Mocha.

### Other changes

- Improve test coverage.
- Improve documentation.
- Update dependencies.

## 2.0.0-alpha.2

### Breaking changes

- Remove globalConfig() ([PR #106])
  - Each request can be independently configured with config() which takes the same options
  - Also removes reset() since that was only useful globalConfig()
- Change to plugin interface ([PR #100])
  - this.current.expects is gone, use after() instead

### Other changes

- Under the hood improvements to code ([PR #100], [PR #105], [PR #107])

## 2.0.0-alpha.1

### Breaking changes

- Make Joi an optional dependency. ([PR #84][])
  - Joi is only used when the developer invokes `expectJSONTypes`
  - The developer must install Joi on their own.
  - The developer can specify the version number of their choice. Upgrading
    IcedFrisby does not affect the Joi version. Joi 12.0.0 works with Node
    6+, 13.0.0 with Node 8+.
  - The developer's specified version is the only copy of Joi installed.

### Bug fixes

- Significantly improve API documentation ([PR #94][])
- Remove `setResponseType` and other `setResponseX` functions which were
  not part of the public API and are unused internally. ([PR #89][])
- Fix `timeout()` and `retry()` ([PR #71][])
  - Retry on errors, not just timeouts
  - Back off between retries
  - Global setup respects `retryBackoff` option
  - Configure Mocha’s timeout to accommodate `.timeout()` and `.retry()`
- Clean up after `useApp()` ([PR #72][])
- Tidy request code ([PR #101][])

## 1.5.0

- Support header checks when multiple same-name headers exist ([PR #73][])
  - Invoke `expectHeader` or `expectHeaderContains` with a third argument
    `{ allowMultipleHeaders: true }`.
- `expectHeader` accepts regexes. `expectHeaderToMatch` is an alias.
  ([PR #73][])
- Upgrade Joi to 12.0.0.
- Drop support for Node 7. Continue support for Node 6 and 8.
- Improve documentation.

[pr #73]: https://github.com/IcedFrisby/IcedFrisby/pull/70

## 1.4.0

- Add only() helper ([PR #70][]).
- Improve documentation

[pr #70]: https://github.com/IcedFrisby/IcedFrisby/pull/70

## 1.3.1

- Add expectNoHeader() helper ([PR #63][]).

[pr #63]: https://github.com/IcedFrisby/IcedFrisby/pull/63

## 1.3.0

- Async hooks for before(), after(), finally() ([PR #59][]).

- Update chalk to ^2.0.1

[pr #59]: https://github.com/IcedFrisby/IcedFrisby/pull/59

## 1.2.0

- Support extending via plugins. Frisby is an ES6 class, and plugins
  themselves are implemented as subclass factories. After being
  composed with plugins, `frisby.create()` will do the right thing.
  For an example, see https://github.com/paulmelnikow/icedfrisby-nock

## 1.1.0

- Added `finally()` hooks which run even after an error and can be used for
  cleanup. Throw a [MultiError][] if more than one error occurs. (#45)
- Fixed issue where printing frisby objects caused side effects (#44)
- Fixed bug where `after()` callbacks are erroneously invoked after an error
  in `before()` hook or request (#45)
- Moved all internal state from the Mocha context to the frisby object (#45)
- Improved test coverage

## < 0.1.0 (forked from [Frisby](https://github.com/vlucas/frisby))

- Refactored all expect() functions

- Adds expectContainsJSON(...)! Test JSON responses without knowing every field.
- Uses [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) instead of underscore
- Returns a 599 (network timeout error) response if a request times out or is unavailable instead of a 500
